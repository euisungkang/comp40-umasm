Eeverything has been correctly implemented.

Departures from convention:
    calc40.ums
        - r5 is used as a nonvolatile register. Mainly used to store the 
          value stack length

    printd.ums
        - r3 is used only as a pointer to the print stack, similar to r2
        - r1, r5 are used as nonvolatile registers

The print module utilizes a secondary print stack to transfer all data
from the value stack whilst printing, and back before resuming the
program.
